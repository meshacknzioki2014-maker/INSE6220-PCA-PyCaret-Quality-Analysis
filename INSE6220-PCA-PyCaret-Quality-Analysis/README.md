## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with supervised machine learning to analyze and classify a multi-attribute quality dataset. The Wine dataset is used as a proxy for industrial quality data, demonstrating how dimensionality reduction and predictive analytics can support quality optimization.

The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and standardization  
- PCA implementation and visualization  
- Machine learning model comparison using PyCaret  
- Performance evaluation and SHAP interpretability
